The Timetable Management System is a Python Flask project that utilizes a MySQL backend to efficiently manage timetables for schools and colleges. Designed with user-friendliness in mind, this system allows administrators to easily add and manage essential components such as staff, subjects, courses, and periods. One of the standout features of the project is the ability for admins to generate timetables randomly, streamlining the scheduling process while ensuring optimal allocation of resources.

Additionally, the system facilitates effective communication by enabling administrators to send notifications regarding staff replacements or substitutions, ensuring that students are always informed about changes in their schedules. The project comprises two main modules: the Admin Module, where administrators can perform all management tasks, and the Student Module, which allows students to view their personalized timetables and stay updated on any changes. By centralizing timetable management and improving communication, the Timetable Management System enhances the overall educational experience, making it easier for both staff and students to navigate their academic schedules.
